# Dictionary Abstract Data Type

This repository contains an implementation of a dictionary abstract data type (ADT). Well-suited for applications 
such as spell-checking and predictive text, the dictionary ADT allows for efficient querying of a collection of
similar strings.

## Usage
1. Download the files `t27.c` and `t27.h`, and place them inside your project directory
2. Add the following line to the top line of your project code or header file:
```
#include "t27.h"
```
3. When compiling your code, include `t27.c` as a dependency along with any other C files:
```
gcc main.c t27.c -o dictionary_program
```

### Supported Operations
- Create a new dictionary
```c
dict* dict_init(void);
```

- Add a string to a dictionary
```c
bool dict_addword(dict* p, const char* wd);
```

- Get the total number of nodes in a dictionary
```c
int dict_nodecount(const dict* p);
```

- Get the number of times a word has been added to a dictionary
```c
int dict_wordcount(const dict* p);
```

- Get the terminal node from a string, given the string is in the dictionary
```c
dict* dict_spell(const dict* p, const char* str);
```

- Get the frequency of the most common string in the dictionary
```c
int dict_mostcommon(const dict* p);
```

- Get the number of nodes separating two different nodes in the same dictionary
```c
unsigned dict_cmp(dict* p1, dict* p2);
```

- Given a string, `wd`, find the most common word in a dictionary beginning with this string. The characters from this most common word that are not found in the original string are assigned to `ret`.
```c
void dict_autocomplete(const dict* p, const char* wd, char* ret);
```

- Free all memory associated with a dictionary
```c
void dict_free(dict** p);
```


## Implementation
Strings are stored using a trie-like data structure, where each node is a structure composed of an array of 27 
pointers to child-nodes, a pointer to the parent node (NULL if node is root), a boolean representing if the node 
is terminal, and a integer representing the frequency of a word in the dictionary (only used in terminal nodes).

```c
struct dict {
    struct dict* child_nodes[27];
    struct dict* parent_node;
    bool terminal;
    int freqency;
};
```

Each pointer to a child node encodes a single character, where its position in the child_nodes[] array encodes 
the specific character. This array can hold up to 27 pointers, with the first 26 of them encoding the letters 
Aâ€“Z and the final one encoding the apostrophe character. A representation of the encoding of the string 'CODE' 
is shown below.

Given the execution of the following code:
```c
dict* d = dict_init();
dict_addword(d, "code");
dict_addword(d, "code");
dict_addword(d, "coder");
dict_addword(d, "coda");
```

the dictionary state can be represented as:

<div align="center">

</div>

Here, nodes displaying a number are terminal, where that number indicates the frequency of the string in the 
dictionary.
